    <div class="about">
      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>Astiegan Watches is a small independant business based on the side of the Lake Neuchâtel, in Switzerland.<br>
      I started collecting vintage watches in the mid 2010s and developed a growing passion for watchmaking. I decided to go further and create an online shop so I could share my discoveries with the world.<br>
      I make sure to be as transparent and honest as possible when describing a watch. I want to build on trust and quality of service. For that, I study each watch carefully about it's condition, authenticity and working order. <br>
      Of course, we are talking about decades old mechanical objects. Therefore it is impossible to know everything from a simple look. A mechanical watch needs to be serviced every few years. Water resistance is not really a thing with old watches. <br>
      I'm also always happy to discuss about the watches listed for sale and am open to trades!</p>
